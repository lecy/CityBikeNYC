# The City Bike NYC final project page

Here is a website where I will present results.

I can show R code like this:

```r

x <- 1:100
y <- 2*x + rnorm(100,0,10)

plot( x, y )
```

But note that regular markdown files do not include output. You need to "knit" an RMD file to include the output.

You can demonstrate your analysis by linking to the HTML pages created by the output.

Here is what a link looks like:

```
[Link to html file](Bikes_Markdown.html)
```

And the live link:

[Link to html file](Bikes_Markdown.html)

As you can see, this file does contain the output to the code. This is called a "data-driven document" because you can include the code and output together to make analysis easier to understand, audit, and reproduce.
